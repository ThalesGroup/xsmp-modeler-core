                In order to arrive at semantically correct (data) type definitions, a structure type may not be recursive, i.e. a structure may not have a field that is typed by the structure itself.

                As the Class metaclass is derived from Structure it can contain constants and fields.
                
                Further, it can have arbitrary numbers of properties (Property elements), operations (**Operation** elements), and associations (**Association** elements).

                An Exception can contain constants and fields (from **Structure**) as well as operations, properties and associations (from **Class**). The fields represent the state variables of the exception which carry additional information when the exception is raised.
                
                Furthermore, an **Exception** may be **Abstract** (from **Class**), and it may inherit from a single base exception (implementation inheritance), which is represented by the Base link (from **Class**).

                An **Interface** may inherit from other interfaces (interface inheritance), which is represented via the Base links.
                
                **Remark**: It is strongly recommended to only use value types, references and other interfaces in the properties and operations of an interface (i.e. not to use models). Otherwise, a dependency between a model implementing the interface, and other models referenced by this interface is introduced, which is against the idea of interface-based or component-based design.

                These mechanisms allow using various different modelling approaches.
                
                For a class-based design, a **Model** may provide a collection of **Field** elements to define its internal state.
                
                For scheduling and global events, a **Model** may provide a collection of **EntryPoint** elements that can be registered with the **Scheduler** or **EventManager** services of a Simulation Environment.
                
                For an interface-based design, a **Model** may provide (i.e. implement) an arbitrary number of interfaces, which is represented via the **Interface** links.
                
                For a component-based design, a **Model** may provide **Container** elements to contain other models (composition), and **Reference** elements to reference other components (aggregation).
                
                These components can either be models or services.
                
                For an event-based design, a **Model** may support inter-model events via the **EventSink** and **EventSource** elements.
                
                For a dataflow-based design, the fields of a **Model** can be tagged as Input or Output fields.
                
                In addition, a **Model** may have **Association** elements to express associations to other models or fields of other models.

                The Service metaclass is a component and hence inherits all component mechanisms.
                
                A Service can reference one or more interfaces via the **Interface** links (inherited from Component), where at least one of them must be derived from Smp::IService, which qualifies it as a service interface.

                This can be used not only to give a meaningful name to an event type, but also to link it to an existing simple type (via the EventArgs attribute) that is passed as an argument with every invocation of the event.

                As with arrays, SMDL does not allow defining variable-sized strings, as these have the same problems as dynamic arrays (e.g. their size is not know up-front, and their use requires memory allocation).

                This mechanism is used within the specification to define the SMDL primitive types with respect to the Metamodel, but it can also be used to define native types within an arbitrary SMDL catalogue for use by models.

                However, the semantics is different in that a property does not represent a state and that it can be assigned an Access attribute to specify how the property can be accessed (either readWrite, readOnly, or writeOnly, see **AccessKind**).
                
                Furthermore, a property can be assigned a **Category** attribute to help grouping the properties within its owning type, and a property may specify an arbitrary number of exceptions that it can raise in its getter (**GetRaises**) and/or setter (**SetRaises**).
                
                **Remark**: The category can be used in applications as ordering or filtering criterion, for example in a property grid. The term "property" used here closely corresponds in its semantics to the same term in the Java Beans specification and in the Microsoft .NET framework. That is, a property formally represents a "getter" or a "setter" operation or both which allow accessing state or configuration information (or derived information thereof) in a controlled way and which can also be exposed via interfaces (in contrast to fields).

                It corresponds to a void operation taking no parameters that can be called from an external client (e.g. the Scheduler or Event Manager services).
                
                An Entry Point can reference both Input fields (which must have their Input attribute set to true) and Output fields (which must have their Output attribute set to true).
                
                These links can be used to ensure that all component output fields are updated before the entry point is called, or that all input fields can be used after the entry point has been called.
